                                Unlike many other industrial sectors, large construction
                                projects in oil & gas, refinery, petrochemical and power
                                industries involve the purchase of a vast number of critical
                                items supplied by many different manufacturers around the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                These items range from raw material to finished products.
                                The diversity of these items includes pipes and tubes;
                                equipment ranging from valves, process skids, pumps, turbines
                                , tanks, motors, control panels; components to boilers, motors,
                                engines for anything from lifting equipment to reactor vessels,
                                electrical and instrumentation equipment.

                                Any purchase carries embedded risk. If a part is faulty
                                and is not detected at the source, the risk of something
                                going wrong becomes embedded within the new asset, and will
                                have significant impact on the schedule of the projects.
                                Quality, Safety, and Schedule are keys for successful
                                execution of any project. It is of vital importance to
                                check at the vendor facility for the quality compliance
                                of every single item, no matter how small it is.
